Learning Objectives
1. Learn how to use arcpy in the creation of;
	a. UniqueValue maps
	b. GraduatedColors (Choropleth) maps

Renderers

	used by ArcGIS to determine how feature data gets drawn on the screen
	Renderers tell the program exactly how that data should be presented to that user
	Four basic feature renderer types
		1. SimpleRenderer
		2. UniqueValueRenderer
		3. GraduatedColorsRenderer
		4. GraduatedSymbolsRenderer
	*Not all layers support renderers, always make sure that they layer has a renderer attribute first
	
SimpleRenderer

	The most basic type of Renderers
	Used to draw all features of a layer the same
	Default renderer; used whenever we add a feature class to a maps
	
UniqueValueRenderer

	Used to distinguish features in a feature layer based off of some clasification, usually a data field
	We are given programmatic control over the ype of field used in the classification of features as well as the color ramp used when drawing the feature
	
GraduatedColorsRenderer

	Used to render features in a feature layer based off of a specific field in the feature class
	Used to create choropleth maps programmatically; useful if you need to quickly produce these maps
	Gives control over the style of choropleth produced; allowing the choice of how many bins are present as well as the color ramp used
	
GraduatedSymbolsRenderer

	Similar to GraduatedColorsRenderer in that each let you render features in a feature class depending on a number of bins and let you specify the color ramp used
	This style is useful for creating graduated symbol style maps
